# Mathematical Modeling Competition Papers Collection

Collection of papers from mathematical modeling competitions I participated in during my undergraduate and graduate studies. This repository contains four papers produced during various competitions, including the Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) and the China Graduate Mathematical Modeling Competition. Our team achieved notable results in these competitions, including being awarded as Meritorious Winners and receiving national third prizes.

## Achievements and Honors

- Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) 2021: Meritorious Winner
- Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) 2022: Meritorious Winner
- China Graduate Mathematical Modeling Competition: National Third Prize

## Papers List

Here is a list of the competition papers included in this repository:

1. **Higher Education (2021)** - This paper investigates various aspects of higher education and was awarded as a Meritorious Winner in the 2021 MCM.
2. **Asteroid Mining (2022)** - Focused on the feasibility and implications of asteroid mining, this work earned the Meritorious Winner title in the 2022 MCM.
3. **War for Talent (2022)** - Analyzes the global competition for skilled talent, earning a ticket to participate in the 2022 MCM.
4. **Ethylene (2021)** - A detailed study on ethylene production processes, narrowly missing a recommendation for the national competition.
5. **Seg Brain (China Graduate Competition)** - This paper, which delves into brain segmentation techniques, was awarded a National Third Prize in the China Graduate Mathematical Modeling Competition.

## My Collaborators

I am immensely grateful for the effort and dedication of my collaborators throughout these competitions. Some of them have gone on to pursue further studies at prestigious institutions like New York University (NYU) and Tsinghua University (THU).

## About Us

The turnaround time for each of our papers was typically three to four days, so there might be areas that are not as polished as we would have liked. Despite this, we are proud of what we accomplished within such tight deadlines and for the recognition our work received. These experiences not only honed our professional skills but also laid a solid foundation for our academic and career paths.
